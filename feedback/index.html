		<h1>Feedback for Cecilia Liu</h1>

		<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The design captures the ironic monotony of <em>The Office</em> with its Arial font.
			</li><li>
			The images are of the characters who spoke the quotes, which is an appropriate design choice.
			</li><li>
			Since only one style was utilized, I can only give feedback for the one, but in general I don't think the style is ineffective, it just runs the risk of illegibility.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Structure</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The biggest issue to consider is how the busy the background is, and how the text's legibility is impacted by it. Using one of the suggested techniques in class, such as a linear gradient or drop shadow, could help with this issue.
			</li><li>
			Because the figures in the images leave a lot of free background, there seems to be an appropriate amount of room for the text to move within the desktop setting. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When the screen changes to mobile, the current design introduces a black box to compensate for the lack of space on the top and bottom. I think utilizing one of the other techniques shown today would be more effective, as well as keep the design consistent from desktop to mobile.
			</li><li>
			It looks like the picture of Dwight on mobile may have some distortion.
			</li><li>
			The font is web-friendly.
			</li><li>
			I think this design is feasible to build.
			</li>
		</ul>
