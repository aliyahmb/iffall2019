			<li>Aliyah Blackburn; Communication Design major, second major in English, minor in art history; junior</li>
			<li>I've touched upon some web design in the past, though rarely from code. I took this class mainly because it's required, but I think it's useful to have some coding languages in my back pocket. What limited knowledge I already have I've used in random circumstances before. I'm hoping to expand on what I already know and then some.</li>
			<li>I only have minimal experience with HTML. I don't know much beyond a few attributes that I learned six years ago.</li>
			<li>I'd like to learn how to make text or an object react to a mouse hover or click.</li>
			<li>You have to take into account the platform the screen is on, as it would affect legibility and clarity of some elements. Designs are impacted by whether the audience is using a mouse or their finger.</li>
			<li><a href="https://outofprint.com/" target="_blank">Out of Print Clothing</a> – This website sells book-themed merchandise. Its font and color choices displays their connection to old books; the items are categorized in different ways, depending on whether the visitor is looking for a specific item or relation to a title.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.moma.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Art</a> – A museum's website is intended to provide direction/clarification for museum vistiors. MoMA puts the most important information at the top, making it easy for first-time visitors to navigate while keeping to the museum's modern theme.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube<a> – As a place where billions of videos exist, YouTube effectively keeps their design simple and concise while keeping the home page relevant to the user's interests.</li>
