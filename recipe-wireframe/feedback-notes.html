			Lauren Jin suggested incorporating pictures throughout the directions, because when she follows online recipes, she uses them as a guide. She also suggested making the other headers italics. For visual learners, she suggested having a video at the beginning and images to break up the text would be useful as both a user and designer.

			I think including the video is definitely useful for people who don't use text to follow along. The images might be a little less clear because I'm using them in sections that encompass a lot of work rather than one simple step; I do think it'll be useful though.
