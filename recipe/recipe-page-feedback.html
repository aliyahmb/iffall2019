		<h2>Peers: Brooke Adler and Natalie Snyder</h2>
		<br>
		<h2>Fonts</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Brooke told me to try different fonts â€“ at least for headers as it comes off a little cartoony. She thought the body font worked well, but told me to at least try something different. </li>
		<li>
		For added emphasis, making headers within the body (such as "make chicken") bold. </li>
		<li>Natalie also suggested differentiating the title of the recipe from the rest of the headers.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Misc</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Change color of link.</li>
		<li>Add footer that includes picture credits.</li>
		<li>Change width of header picture.</li>
		<li>Change width of "Get Ingredients" button.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Areas that work </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Colors are expressive of recipe, which works well.</li>
			<li>Images are useful when going through recipe.</li>
			<li>The ability to get ingredients is helpful.</li>
			<li>Legibility is clear.</li>
